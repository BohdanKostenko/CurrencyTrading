# CurrencyTrading

Given a matrix of currency pair exchange rates, a Python 3.10 algorithm is built that either finds a profitable risk-free trading strategy and presents it,
or prints "no risk-free opportunities" in case there is no profitable risk-free currency trading strategy.

To run the script, use the command in terminal:

    $ python trading.py PATH
    
Where PATH is the path to your .csv file
